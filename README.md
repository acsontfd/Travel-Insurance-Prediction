# Travel Insurance Purchasing Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase travel insurance based on various demographic and financial factors. The model analyzes features such as age, employment type, annual income, family size, medical history, travel habits, and more to determine the likelihood of insurance purchase.

📌 Features

✅ Preprocessed and cleaned dataset for better model performance
✅ Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✅ Trained machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
✅ Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
✅ Insights into factors influencing travel insurance purchases

🚀 Technologies Used
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	•	Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, etc.)
	•	Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization

📊 Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX%, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and decision-making for travel insurance providers.

📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of customer demographics, financial data, and travel history. It has been cleaned and preprocessed to ensure optimal model performance.

💡 Use Case
